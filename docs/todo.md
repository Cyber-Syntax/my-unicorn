# TODO List

- [ ] Remove overengineering of Strategy and Template Method patterns:
    " If you only have a couple of algorithms and they rarely change, thereâ€™s no real reason to overcomplicate the program with new classes and interfaces that come along with the pattern." by <https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy>
    "Template methods tend to be harder to maintain the more steps they have.  You might violate the Liskov Substitution Principle by suppressing a default step implementation via a subclass." by <https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method>
