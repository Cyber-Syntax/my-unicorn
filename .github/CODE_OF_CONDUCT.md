# CODE OF CONDUCT

1. **Respect Simplicity:** Keep contributions simple and focused on the project goals. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity.
2. **Limited Scope:** Contributions are welcome, but the project is personal and learning-focused, so not all suggestions or code may be accepted.
3. **Constructive Feedback:** Share feedback respectfully, keeping in mind the learning purpose of the project.
4. **Patience and Understanding:** The project may not always be actively maintained, so responses or updates might take time.
5. **No Harassment:** Respectful and professional behavior is mandatory in all interactions.
