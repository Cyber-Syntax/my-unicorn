# Python Coding Rules

- Always add comments.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for code formatting.
- Use meaningful variable and function names in snake_case.
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants.
- Use CamelCase for class names.
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules following the Google style guide.
- Use type hints to indicate parameter and return types.
- Use f-strings for string formatting instead of older methods.
- Implement proper exception handling with specific exception types.
- Use logging instead of print statements for recording key actions and errors.
- Store configuration in separate files (e.g., YAML, JSON, or .env) rather than hardcoding in scripts.
- Always check return values from functions that may fail.
- Write descriptive error messages that help diagnose the problem.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Use proper scoping for variables (avoid globals).
