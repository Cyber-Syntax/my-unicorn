# Python Coding Rules

- Comment only to explain why code exists or complex reasoning.
- Avoid redundant comments that repeat what the code already shows.
- Write docstrings for public functions, classes, and modules only.
- Keep docstrings concise and focused on usage information.
- Name variables and functions descriptively to reduce need for comments.
- Create functions that perform a single task with a clear name.
- Organize large codebases into focused, well-named modules.
- Prioritize code clarity over cleverness.
- Create functions that perform a single task well.
- Place reusable functions in their own modules.
- Design modules and functions with a single, clear purpose.
- Name variables and functions in lowercase_with_underscores.
- Avoid global variables when possible.
- Name constants in ALL_UPPERCASE.
- Name classes in CapitalizedWords.
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules.
- Include type hints for parameters and return values.
- Use f-strings for string formatting.
- Catch specific exceptions, not broad exception types.
- Use logging for recording actions and errors.
- Write helpful, descriptive error messages.
- Avoid print statements for application output.
- Store configuration settings separately from code.
- Check return values from functions that might fail.
- Limit variable scope appropriately.
- Make code modular to improve testing and maintenance.
- Use HTTPS for all API communications.
- Load sensitive configuration values only at runtime.
- Keep sensitive information out of logs and error messages.
- Never include secrets or passwords in source code.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use secure hashing with unique salts for passwords.
