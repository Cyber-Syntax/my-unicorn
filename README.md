## For using uncompatible apps (installing with URL):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to install an uncompatible app, you'll need to know some information about the application.

- **GitHub URL:** The repository URL of the app (e.g., `https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity`).
- Hash type and Hash file name are automatically detected. You need to provide below informations, if the app compatibility is not available or error occurs:
    - **Hash type:** Specify the hash type (e.g., sha512 for super-productivity).
    - **Hash verification issues:** If the hash verification fails, you can manually add the hash to the JSON file:
        - Look for the latest hash in the GitHub release page (e.g., [super-productivity releases](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/releases)).
        - Check the [apps](my_unicorn/apps/) folder for examples.
