- Detailed:
    - You can use it by choosing what to do from the list.
    - First you need to know the "github url" of the application you want to download.
    - After knowing this, if you want to make sure that the downloaded file is not changed while it is being downloaded for security purposes, you should also know the full name of the file that is commonly used for linux, such as sha512, sha1...
    - Also, do not forget to write hash type and appimage directory.
