# üí° Installation

> [!TIP]
> Installer script uses venv to install the needed dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads &
    git clone https://github.com/Cyber-Syntax/my-unicorn.git
    ```

2. Build as a package:

    ```bash
    cd my-unicorn &
    sh setup.sh install
    ```

3. Add autocomplete (optional):

    ```bash
    # auto-detect your shell and install autocomplete
    sh setup.sh autocomplete

    # or manually add autocomplete for bash or zsh
    sh setup.sh autocomplete bash
    sh setup.sh autocomplete zsh
    ```

    ```

## For using uncompatible apps (installing with URL)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to install an uncompatible app, you'll need to know some information about the application.

- **GitHub URL:** The repository URL of the app (e.g., `https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity`).
- Hash type and Hash file name are automatically detected. You need to provide below informations, if the app compatibility is not available or error occurs:
    - **Hash type:** Specify the hash type (e.g., sha512 for super-productivity).
    - **Hash verification issues:** If the hash verification fails, you can manually add the hash to the JSON file:
        - Look for the latest hash in the GitHub release page (e.g., [super-productivity releases](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/releases)).
        - Check the [catalog](my_unicorn/catalog/) folder for examples.
